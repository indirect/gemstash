# Deploying Gemstash

Bundler is here for the rescue to keep Gemstash up to date! Create a
`Gemfile` pointing to Gemstash:

``` ruby
# ./Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "gemstash"
```

Then `bundle` to create your `Gemfile.lock`. When you are ready to
upgrade, simply `bundle update`. You may need to run `gemstash` via
`bundle exec`. Alternatively, you can `gem uninstall gemstash` and
`gem install gemstash` when you want to upgrade.

Gemstash will automatically run any necessary migrations, so updating
the gem is all that needs to be done.

It is probably wise to stop Gemstash before upgrading, then starting
again once you are done:

    $ bundle exec gemstash stop
    $ bundle update
    $ bundle exec gemstash start

## Monitoring

Health monitoring is built in to Gemstash using the
[server_health_check-rack](https://github.com/on-site/server_health_check-rack)
gem. If you request `/health` from your Gemstash instance, you will get
a JSON response along with an HTTP status code indicating success or
failure. The JSON response will look something like this for a success
case:

    {
      "status": {
        "heartbeat": "OK",
        "storage_read": "OK",
        "storage_write": "OK",
        "db_read": "OK",
        "db_write": "OK"
      }
    }

This request will test storage and database access and report on the
result. Each key in the status can be requested alone to just report on
that status. For example, if you would like a health check that doesnâ€™t
interact with storage or the database, you can use `/health/heartbeat`
which will always respond with a success while your Gemstash server is
running.

## Downgrading

It is not recommended to go backwards in Gemstash versions. Migrations
may have run that could leave the database in a bad state.
