# Using Gemstash as a Mirror

If you don’t have control over your `Gemfile`, or you don’t want to
force everyone on your team to go through the Gemstash server, you can
use Bundler mirroring to bundle against your Gemstash server.

For each source in your `Gemfile`, add a mirror pointing to your
Gemstash server:

    $ bundle config mirror.http://rubygems.org http://localhost:9292
    $ bundle config mirror.https://my.gem-source.local http://localhost:9292/upstream/$(ruby -rcgi -e 'puts CGI.escape("https://my.gem-source.local")')

From now on, bundler will fetch gems from those sources via your
Gemstash server.

# Simpler Gemstash Mirrors

**This feature requires Bundler to be at least version `1.11.0`.**

If you are using Bundler version `1.11.0` or greater, the mirroring
becomes a bit easier:

    $ bundle config mirror.http://rubygems.org http://localhost:9292
    $ bundle config mirror.https://my.gem-source.local http://localhost:9292

Bundler will then send headers to Gemstash to indicate the correct
upstream.
